            <h1>Hi friend! Glad you were able to make it to my Webpage.</h1>
            <h2>My name is Monique Lourido Martinez.</h2>
            <p>I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering Student at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, 
                currently coursing my capstone project. I graduated on 2018 with bachelors in Economics from the University of 
                Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras. 
            </p>

            <p>After I finished by bachelors in Economics, I worked as a Junior Econimist, this endevour didn't last too long. Shortly After
             I started working within a consmer goods company within the Retail Marketing Department. Here I was able to put 
             my analytical skills into use by creating data into insights. </p>

            <p>A short time after this, I moved laterally into the Customer Development Department. Here I further honed my 
                        skills by analyzing data for specific accounts within the Drug and Warehouse environments. </p>

            <p>But, time rolled by, and the pandemic hit. By then I was working remotely. Because of this I decided to spend 
                        more time in hobbies I'd had picked up and let go in the past. Once of these hobbies was playing the Ukulele, but the other 
                        was coding, specifically python.</p>

            <p>Python was my first programming experience, and I had picked it back in 2017, when I was a senior at the University of Puerto Rico
                        for my first bachelors. </p>

                    "For what its worth it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit. Stop whenever 
                    you want. You can change or stay the same, there are rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the
                    best of it. And I hope you see thingsthat startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a 
                    different points of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again."
