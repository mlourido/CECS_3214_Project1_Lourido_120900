        <blockquote>Travel isn't always pretty. It isn't always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that's okay.
            The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, 
            on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you.
            Hopefully, you leave something good behind.
